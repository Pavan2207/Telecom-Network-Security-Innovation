- Monitor live network traffic
- Detect unusual or suspicious behavior
- Identify insecure websites and leaked passwords
- Help prevent cyber attacks in telecom systems

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Live packet sniffing (data monitoring)  
✅ Detects threats like unknown access, password leaks, or insecure websites  
✅ Uses AI to find patterns in network activity  
✅ Saves logs and generates reports  
✅ Shows alerts and results on a user-friendly dashboard
